#Report


__This short report will cover the tools used in this project and how I may implement them into my development practice. I hadn't used any of these tools before.__

###Pycharm
Pycharm is the IDE used for this project, which is designed for use with Python.     Pycharm was useful for my development practice as debugging could be done through looking at a list of exceptions or red underlining. Furthermore, being able to manage files, use the terminal and also run from the toolbar meant designing my project in pycharm was more efficient than using Python itself. In future I will maintain the use of Pycharm as an IDE.

###Github

Github is a version control tool which stores projects as a repository. In my development practice I committed changes locally then pushed them to the repository. This was useful, not only for version control but also as it allowed me to easily work from multiple devices. I was also able to initially clone the repository from github to work on it locally, which meant I didn't need to set up the original files used for the project. In future, I will continue to use github for these reasons, and also to roll back to earlier versions if a project breaks.

###Panda3D

Panda3D is a 3D game design tool. This was the key tool in my development practice as it's library contained methods of moving the camera and changing the panda's appearance etc, as well as containing the textures and models required. In future, I may use Panda3D for simple 3D game design as programming in python is simple compared to other game design languages. 

###Markdown

Markdown is a language used for creating formatted text. This means you can use it to create titles and bold text etc. Markdown is useful for creating documents such as this one as it is more structured than a standard plaintext txt file, which allows better readability. I expect to use Markdown to create documents like this in future, as it is easy to submit a .md file as part of a zipped git repository to be assessed.

###Python

Python is the programming language used for this project. As I had not used python before, creating the walking panda project meant I had to learn syntax and other concepts of the language. Particularly, not having to declare variables before using them differed from my previous experience. In future I will continue to use Python as it is the main coding language for semester 1, and because it is versatile in it's applications and syntactically simple.
