__This short report will cover the tools used in this project and how I may implement them into my development practice. I hadn't used any of these tools before.__

###Pycharm
Pycharm is the IDE used for this project. Pycharm was useful for my development practice as debugging could be done through looking at a list of exceptions or red underlining. In future I will maintain the use of Pycharm as an IDE.

###Github

Github is a version control tool which stores projects as a repository. In my development practice I committed changes locally then pushed them to the repository. This was useful, not only for version control but also as it allowed me to easily work from multiple devices. In future, I will continue to use github for this reason, and also to roll back to earlier versions if a project breaks.

###Panda3D

Panda3D is a 3D game design tool. This was the key tool in my development practice as it's library contained methods of moving the camera and changing the panda's appearance etc, as well as containing the textures and models required. In future, I may use Panda3D for simple 3D game design as programming in python is simple compared to other game design languages.
